       "review": "Honda brand Cars stand the test of time. The affordability when repairs are needed are one of the major reasons I would purchase another Honda. The only issues I came across were with the AC and some minor electrical issues. The AC apparently had some issues that were addressed company wide and when I went to a Honda Service Center, The problem was fixed free of charge. As for the electrical issues, I have not had any clear reason told to me of why they occur but have heard from other Honda Owners that they have also experienced small electrical errors. Those issues include the radio/gps monitor and connection",

       "review": "I purchased a used Honda vehicle, 2014 model, in great condition. After paying 19K for this vehicle, after the first month of owning this vehicle the paint start peeling off the trunk door (Honda Odyssey), and around the door frames. After doing some research I found out that there was a defect with the paint used on Honda Odysseys for the year of my vehicle. Honda knew about this defect and so extended their warranty for 7 years, great. However, for those of us purchasing a vehicle used because we can't afford to purchase new, we don't find out about FACTORY DEFECTS until after the crap hits the fan.",

Within 24 hours of the purchase I regretted this decision because the car was not of equal quality to the car I had drove in there. The general manager called me to tell me she would not give me my original car back.",

       "review": "I recently had the misfortune of purchasing a car (2018 Honda Fit) with Honda Sensing enabled. Within a week, I discovered that the sensors are so flaky as to render the car unsafe to drive - while I was unable to trigger them at all during the test drive (as they sometimes fail to detect anything), the opposite problem (seeing something that isn't there) is where the car becomes unsafe. 3 times in 60 miles of highway driving, the car applied maximum brakes without warning. The road in front of me was clear for several miles (and thankfully also clear behind me), but it always triggered as I was just about to finish passing another car. This compounded the risk of brake checking - had someone been behind me, they absolutely would have rear-ended me, as they would have had no place to go to dodge my vehicle, and absolutely no way to anticipate my car applying the brakes at maximum for several seconds.",

       "review": "I purchased a new, 2022 Honda Ridgeline Black Edition just a little over two weeks ago. When my vehicle was less than two weeks old, with under 500kms it began throwing warning lights. The awd stopped working and my heater shut down entirely (in minus 30 weather). I was getting a total of eight different warning lights and I couldn't move my electric seats to be able to drive safely. Once I got my vehicle home it would no longer start. I figured no big deal, my vehicle hasn't even gone through its first tank of gas, Honda has a great reputation and will take care of me.",
